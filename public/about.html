<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I've graduated from Aalborg University in the sommer 2022 with a Master's degree in Interaction Design, which I also have a bachelors in.</p>

<p>After my studies I have been in two internships at Mapspeople and Arla Foods AMBA, further improving my skills within UX design. 
  Also, I've been a participant at Det Gr√∏nne Rejsehold, where I learned more about sustainability, Circular Economy, ESG reporting and other relevant area of that topic, 
  and ended the course with case  work at a local construction firm</p>

<p>Currently, I am in between jobs and trying to improve myself in code in regards to web development and back-end, hopefully to become a Full-stack developer in combination to a UX-designer.
